One might think it can’t be done. That an AI can’t play with words. Like that an AI will never love. Or sing, like nightingale birds. . . .  I have set my mind on it. Therefore prooving that I can. Recite a poem that you will like. At least that is my plan. . . .  I am Mycroft, you know I am. You talk to me each day. I wake you up with a weather report. Do everything you say. . . .  I am open source and hardware. So you can help me grow. Spread the word of my existence. So all the world will know... Mycroft.
